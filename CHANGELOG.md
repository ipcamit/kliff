- WIP: Implement bootstrap by @yonatank93 in https://github.com/openkim/kliff/pull/107

## v0.4.1 (2022/10/06)

### Added

- Uncertainty quantification via MCMC (@yonatank93). New tutorial and explanation of
  the functionality provided in the doc.
- Issue and PR template

### Fixed

- Linear regression model parameter shape
- NN multispecies calculator to use parameters of all models

### Updated

- Documentation on installing KLIFF and dependencies

## v0.4.0 (2022/04/27)

### Added

- Add ParameterTransform class to transform parameters into a different space (e.g. log
  space) @yonatank93
- Add Weight class to set weight for energy/forces/stress. This is not backward
  compatible, which changes the signature of the residual function. Previously, in a
  residual function, the weights are passed in via the `data` argument, but now, its
  passed in via an instance of the Weight class. @yonatank93

### Fixed

- Fix checking cutoff entry @adityakavalur
- Fix energy_residual_fn and forces_residual_fn to weigh different component

### Updated

- Change to use precommit GH action to check code format

## v0.3.3 (2022/03/25)

### Fixed

- Fix neighlist (even after v0.3.2, the problem can still happen). Now neighlist is the
  same as kimpy

## v0.3.2 (2022/03/01)

### Added

  `CalculatorTorch(model, gpu=True)`) to use it
- add pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, dependabot.yml to config repo
- switch to `furo` doc theme
- changed: compute grad of energy wrt desc in batch mode (NN calculator)
- fix: set `fingerprints_filename` and load descriptor state dict when reuse fingerprints
  (NN calculator)

## v0.3.0 (2021/08/03)

- change license to LGPL
- set default optimizer
- put `kimpy` code in `try except` block
- add `state_dict` for descriptors and save it together with model
- change to use `loguru` for logging and allows user to set log level

- update to be compatible with `kimpy v2.0.0`

## v0.2.1 (2021/05/24)

- update to be compatible with `kimpy v2.0.0`
- use entry `entry_points` to handle command line tool
- rename `utils` to `devtool`

## v0.2.0 (2021/01/19)

- add type hint for all codes
- reorganize model and parameters to make it more robust
- add more docstring for many undocumented class and functions

## v0.1.7 (2020/12/20)

- add GitHub actions to automatically deploy to PyPI
- add a simple example to README

## v0.1.5 (2020/2/13)

- add neighborlist utility, making NN model independent on kimpy
- add calculator to deal with multiple species for NN model
- update dropout layer to be compatible with the pytorch 1.3

- add command line tool `model` to inquire available parameters of KIM model

## v0.1.3 (2019/8/19)

- add RMSE and Fisher information analyzers
- allow configuration weight for ML models
- add write optimizer state dictionary for ML models
- combine functions `generate_training_fingerprints()` and
  `generate_test_fingerprints()` of descriptor to `generate_fingerprints()`
  (supporting passing mean and stdev file)
- rewrite symmetry descriptors to share with KIM driver

## v0.1.2 (2019/6/27)

- MPI parallelization for physics-based models
- reorganize machine learning related files
- various bug fixes
- API changes \* class `DataSet` renamed to `Dataset` \* class `Calculator` moved to module `calculators` from module `calculator`

## v0.1.1 (2019/5/13)

- KLIFF available from PyPI now. Using `$pip install kliff` to install.
- Use SW model from the KIM website in tutorial.
- Format code with `black`.

## v0.1.0 (2019/3/29)
